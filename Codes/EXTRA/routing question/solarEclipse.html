    A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth,
    and the Moon fully or partially blocks the Sun's rays. It is a spectacular
    celestial event that attracts attention from people all around the world.

    During a solar eclipse, the sky darkens, and the temperature drops. It's
    important to use proper eye protection when observing a solar eclipse to
    avoid damaging your eyes.
